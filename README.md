# How It Works

At the start of each round, the Computer randomly chooses a letter.
The User tries to guess the Computer's letter by pressing on any letter key from 'a' to 'z.'
The letters selected by the User shows up in 'Letters Guessed' for up to 9 times (the number of guesses the User has to select the Computer's letter).
When the User correcly guesses the letter, the User wins by 1 point.
When the User incorrectly guesses the letter, the 'Number of Guesses' decreases by 1.
When the User runs out of guesses, the User loses by 1 point.
The game restarts once the User wins or loses.
